# Meeshkan Community Code of Conduct 

The Meeshkan community is dedicated to providing a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free space and experience for all community participants, regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, socioeconomic status, body size, ethnicity, nationality, level of experience, age, religion (or lack thereof), or other identity markers. 

Our Code of Conduct exists because of that dedication, and we do not tolerate harassment in any form. Within this repo, you can find both our [reporting guidelines](./incident-reporting.md) and [full Code of Conduct](./long-form-code-of-conduct.md).

Please note that our Code of Conduct applies to all Meeshkan community spaces, including but not limited to: Meeshkan open source repositories, any Meeshkan community events, as well as in one-on-one communications pertaining to Meeshkan community business.

This is a living document. If you have any feedback, you can create an [issue in the Github repository](https://github.com/Meeshkan/code-of-conduct/issues).
